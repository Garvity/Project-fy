🔹 Resume Only
Questions that focus purely on the uploaded resume's content:

"List the projects done by the candidate"
"What are the candidate's technical skills?"
"What is the candidate's educational background?"
"Summarize the candidate's work experience"
"What certifications does the candidate have?"
"What programming languages does the candidate know?"


🔹 Job Description Only
Questions about the JD you pasted (requires JD to be entered):

"What are the key skills required for this role?"
"What is the minimum experience required?"
"Summarize the main responsibilities of this position"
"What tools and technologies are mentioned in this job?"
"Is this role remote or on-site?"

🔹 All (Resume + JD + Vector Store)
Comparative questions that look at both resume and JD together:

"How well does the candidate fit this job description?"
"What skills is the candidate missing for this role?"
"What are the candidate's strongest matching qualifications?"
"Suggest improvements to make this resume a better match"
"Does the candidate's experience level match this role?"
"What are the candidate's strengths and weaknesses for this position?"

🔹 Vector Store Only
Questions that pull from the FAISS database of job descriptions and resumes, matched against the uploaded resume's skills:

"What job descriptions could be a perfect match for the candidate's resume?"
"What types of roles match the candidate's skill set?"
"Find similar job postings for this candidate"
"Are there any resumes in the database with a similar profile?"
"What career paths align with the candidate's background?"

Note: "Resume Only" and "All" are the most useful for day-to-day use.
 "Vector Store Only" is best for discovering matching job postings from the database.
  "Job Description Only" is useful when you just want to understand a JD without comparing it to a resume.
